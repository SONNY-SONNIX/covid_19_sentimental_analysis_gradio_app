 # COVID-19 Vaccination Sentiment Analysis and Deployment as a Gradio Web App on Huggingface
 ## Introduction
The creation of COVID-19 vaccinations was a key milestone in public health, suggesting a solution to restrict the virusâ€™s transmission and save lives. However, the â€˜anti-vaxxerâ€™ movement has emerged in some regions, leading to lower vaccination rates and potential outbreaks of preventable diseases. To help solve this issue, I created a gradio web app by fine-tuning some huggingface text classification models. The 3 test classification models I fine-tuned were Twitter_roBETRa_base, distilbert-base-uncased and BERT-base-uncased. These models can assess public sentiment toward vaccination by categorizing Twitter messages as favorable, neutral, or negative. Governments and public health players can better understand the prevailing attitudes by monitoring sentiment and tailoring communication methods and immunization programs accordingly.

ðŸ”§ Installation
To get started , follow these installation steps:

# setup the environment on windows by running the following code.
python -m venv venv; venv\Scripts\activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -r requirements.txt  

#On Linux
python3 -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -r requirements.txt 
The Two commands are of the same structure 1.Activate the python environment 2.Upgrade pip to it current version 3.install the requirements located in requirements.txt: You should be at the root of your env

## ðŸš€ Usage
To see how the app works, follow these instructions: 

1.After setting up enviroment,activatig the environment, and installing requirments, type

gradio run <python_script> #in the terminal

This will open the App in your browser
